Hey team,

I'll be out of the office this week but please make sure that our contract with Skytrain Inc gets completed.

This has been our first job since the "rm -rf" incident and we can't mess this up. Whenever one of you gets on please have a look at the internal tool they sent over. There have been a handful of tickets submitted that have been failing validation and I need you to figure out why.

I set up the permissions for you to test this. Good luck.
